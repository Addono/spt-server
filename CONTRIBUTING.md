# Contributing to This Repository

Thank you for your interest in contributing! Please read the following guidelines to ensure your contribution aligns with the project's goals and policies.

## Project Scope

This repository is primarily the working copy of a personal SPT server instance, tailored for a specific deployment. While it serves as a reference for others, its main goal is to support the current running setup. Contributions are welcome, but must not interfere with the existing deployment or core configuration.

**Out of scope for now:**
- Changing the list of mods, even if a more "vanilla" template would arguablly be useful for most following this guide. If community interest grows, the repository may be split into two: one for a vanilla template, and one for the personal instance.
- Adding support for other hosting platforms.
- Any other non-backwards compatible changes with existing deploys.


## Acceptable Contributions

Contributions are especially welcome for:
1. Documentation improvements and updates
2. Additional resources or clarifications to help others set up their own instance
3. Updates to outdated mods (as long as they do not cause upgrade issues)

For broader or community-specific changes, consider using the Wiki to track and share your modifications.

## Contributing Process

You are welcome to submit Merge Requests (MRs) directly for changes that clearly fit the goals and scope of this repository. However, if you are unsure whether your proposed change aligns with the project's direction, please open an issue first to discuss your idea before submitting an MR.

**Guidelines:**
- Any issue or MR must include a clear and complete description of what is being proposed and why it is needed.
- Use issues to discuss potential changes, request features, or report problems.
- Use MRs for well-defined contributions that are ready for review.

This process helps ensure that all contributions are relevant, well-understood, and maintain the stability of the project.

## Commit Message Guidelines

Please ensure that all commit messages follow the [Semantic Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification. This helps keep the project history clear and makes it easier to understand the purpose of each change.

A few examples:
- feat: add support for new mod configuration
- fix: resolve startup crash on Fly.io
- docs(README): update setup instructions in README

## Strict Policy: No Referral or Affiliate Links

**Any contribution that adds referral or affiliate links is strictly against the policies of this repository and will not be accepted.**
